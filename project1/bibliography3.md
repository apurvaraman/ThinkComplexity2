Gómez, J. M. and Verdú, M. Network theory may explain the vulnerability of medieval human settlements to the Black Death pandemic. Sci. Rep. 7, 43467; doi: 10.1038/srep43467 (2017).

Gómez et. al. use the Old World Trade Routes Dataset to construct a network model of Black Death transmission in human settlements at the time to determine what settlements were affected most by the pandemic. They use simulation and study the properties of the network from the dataset and use the results to observe infection patterns. They found that reinfection of central cities was instrumental in perpetuating the destruction of the plague. The model could be extended to examine what would happen if parameters like centrality were altered. The summary data for each city is included in the supplementary information. b
