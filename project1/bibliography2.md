Onaga, T., Gleeson, J., & Masuda, M. (2017). [Concurrency-Induced Transitions in Epidemic Dynamics on Temporal Networks](https://comdig.unam.mx/2017/09/10/concurrency-induced-transitions-in-epidemic-dynamics-on-temporal-networks/) *Physical Review Letters, 199(10)*.

Onaga et. al. model social contact networks (which have application in epidemiology and in studying how information is disseminated). They study the effects concurrency (the number of neighbors a node has at a point in time) on the spread of something through the network. They conclude that the epidemic threshold is higher when nodes have less concurrency but lower with high concurrency (even when the density of edges is the same). They do this both analytically and through simulation. This model is explanatory in that it provides some "theoretical underpinning" for the fairly intuitive assumption that if there is higher concurrency, it is easier to spread something to the population. An additional question that could be answered is how different is the epidemic threshold when a few nodes have many edges whereas others have few edges versus when each node has roughly the same number of edges as the other nodes.
