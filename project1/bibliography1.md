Murakami, M., Ishikura, S., Kominami, D., Shimokawa, T., & Murata, M. (2017). [Robustness and efficiency in interconnected networks with changes in network assortativity](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s41109-017-0025-4?site=appliednetsci.springeropen.com). *Applied Network Science, 2(1)*.

 Murakami et. al. enumerate the effects of assortativity (preference for nodes to attach to similar nodes) on robustness (how the network responds to removal of nodes/edges) for various types of networks (including Erdös-Rényi and Barabási-Albert) and make recommendations based on that for how to construct robust networks. They propose that the next step should be to create a generative model for network topology. The article was published in a peer-reviewed journal, but has not been cited (although it was published recently).
